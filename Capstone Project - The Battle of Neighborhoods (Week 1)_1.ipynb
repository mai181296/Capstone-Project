    "1. Store needs to be strategically located inside the biggest concentration of restaurants in Toronto area.Â¶\n",
    "2. Confirm any assumption by means of modeling and testing the data. Specifically, visually cluster common restaurants in Toronto by neighborhood.\n",
    "3. Additionally determine that a good number people can frequent these restaurants with sustainable frequency inside these neighborhoods.\n",
